# Booklet creator

This little scirpt can create a booklet based on list of images you have
when you want to have A6 book with songs and staple the pages with a stapler
but you have only a directory of images with songs.

By this script you can prepare few pdf documents based on your directories with images
and then you can just print PDF file doble sided flip on long side, cut paper in a half of
longer side and staple them with stappler

## Usage
python make_booklet.py /home/user/songs

Asumption - in /home/user/songs you have another directories with your jpg files

For example, if you have your jpgs in directory /home/user/songs/flute and /home/user/songs/sax
you need to provide /home/user/songs path

I have multiple voices/instruments in my band and I needed a way to quickly go throuth all of them 
so I implemented such solution ;)
